<div class="pqr"> History of Jammu & Kashmir</div>
<p style="color: azure;"> Jammu and Kashmir's history includes ancient Hindu and Buddhist influences, followed by rule from the Mughal, Afghan, and Sikh empires. In 1846, the Dogra ruler Gulab Singh established the princely state, which joined India in 1947 following a tribal invasion, a decision that led to the first Indo-Pakistani war. The region's special status was defined by Article 370, but this was abrogated in 2019, and the state was reorganized into two union territories: Jammu and Kashmir, and Ladakh. </p>
<p style="color: aqua;">
Ancient and medieval period</p>
<p style="color: azure;">The region was ruled by various dynasties, including the Mauryas and Kushans, before later being part of the Mughal and Sikh empires.
Notable rulers include Ashoka, who introduced Buddhism, and Zain-ul-Abedin, known for his patronage of arts and music.</p> 
<p style="color: aqua;">Princely state era</p>
<p style="color: azure;">In 1846, the British established the princely state under the Dogra ruler Gulab Singh after the First Anglo-Sikh War.
The state was ruled by a succession of Maharanajas until 1947. </p>
<p style="color: aqua;">Post-independence</p>
<p style="color: azure;">At the time of India's independence, the ruler Maharaja Hari Singh initially hesitated to accede to either India or Pakistan.

After a tribal invasion from Pakistan, he signed the Instrument of Accession to India in October 1947.
This led to the First Indo-Pakistani War and established the region as a part of India, which was later given a special status under Article 370. 
</p><p style="color: aqua;">Recent history</p>
<p style="color: azure;">On August 5, 2019, the Indian government revoked Article 370, ending the special status of Jammu and Kashmir.
The state was reorganized into two separate union territories: Jammu and Kashmir, and Ladakh.</p></p>
